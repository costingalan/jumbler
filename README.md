# jumbler
Basic Bash file encoder. Although it's more of a POC access inconvenience than foolproof encoder.

# Usage
To "jumble" a file, use "./jumble.sh [filename]"
To generate a jumbled copy, use "./jumble.sh [filename] [destination file]"

The process is reversed by applying the script to a file again.
